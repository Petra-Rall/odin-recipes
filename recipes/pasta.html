    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p class="des">Simple, classic pasta recipes are always a crowd pleaser and naturally budget friendly. 
       Plus, with so many specialty-diet-friendly pastas on the market today, pasta is even more versatile than ever.</p>
    <p>Bucatini is one of our top favorite pastas! 
       It's a long thin noodle just like spaghetti, but with hole through the middle. 
       It's extra thickness gives it a better bite and holds up to a rich tomato sauce. 
       Bucatini all'Amatriciana is made with pancetta and adds extra saltiness and flavor to the otherwise classic tomato sauce.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 lb. bucatini</li>
        <li>6 oz. pancetta, cut into 1/2" pieces</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Pecorino, for garnish</li>
        <li>Freshly chopped basil, for garnish</li>

    </ul>

    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente according to package directions. Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>In another large pot over medium heat, cook pancetta until crispy, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to a paper towel–lined plate. Drain all but 2 tablespoons of fat from pot. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add tomatoes and butter. Bring to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and more red pepper flakes, if desired.</li>
        <li>Add cooked pasta, ¼ cup pasta water, and pancetta and toss to combine, adding more pasta water if necessary to help loosen and bind the sauce to the pasta.</li>
        <li>Serve topped with lots of Pecorino and fresh basil.</li>
